# Motivation: 
The motivation behind the Flight Price Prediction problem statement is to provide 
customers with accurate and reliable information about the cost of air travel. Flight prices 
can be affected by a variety of factors, including the time of year, day of the week, the 
destination, the airline, and the availability of seats. These factors can make it difficult for 
travellers to determine the best time to book a flight or the best airline to use for their trip. 
In later part of our project, using machine learning algorithms we intend to predict flight 
prices, to provide customers with valuable information that can help them save money and 
make more informed decisions about their travel plans. This can benefit not only customers 
but also airlines and travel agencies, who can use the predictions to optimize their pricing 
strategies and improve customer satisfaction. To cater the needs of customer we have 
developed a website as well, which allows user to predict the possible flight fare based on
factors which impacts it directly. We have also showcased insights, analysing our dataset to 
show which factor impacts price in what ways. End user will get fair idea of when to perform 
their booking to get best price.


# Goal: 
Overall, the goal behind the Flight Price Prediction problem statement is to provide 
travellers with better transparency and pricing accuracy while enabling businesses to 
optimize their pricing strategies and improve their competitiveness in the market
